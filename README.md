# About
Truly Optimized is an optimized Minecraft modpack designed to maximize performance with quality of life features. Built on the Quilt mod loader, Truly Optimized offers a streamlined and modern modding toolchain with an open ecosystem. The modpack does not include content mods, making it fully client-side and compatible with any Minecraft server.

## Benefits
Truly Optimized offers significant benefits for Minecraft players, including:

+ Improved gameplay
+ Faster load times
+ Reduced lag
+ Improved FPS

By using the most effective optimization mods on the market, Truly Optimized provides unmatched performance optimization.

## Optimization Mods
Truly Optimized uses a [range of optimization mods](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods) to maximize Minecraft performance, including:

+ Sodium
+ Lithium
+ Starlight

These mods have been tested and optimized to ensure that Minecraft runs at maximum performance and speed.

## Tweaks
Truly Optimized includes preset tweaks designed to maximize performance and gameplay without any additional configuration needed. These tweaks optimize various minecraft configurations, ensuring that players get the best possible performance without having to make any changes themselves.

## Improved Quality of Life
Minecraft modding has become increasingly popular in recent times, and it has a significant impact on the overall user experience. With the implementation of mods like Essential and Journey Map, Minecraft players can improve the functionality and usability of the game, thereby enhancing their quality of life.
These mods have been implemented carefully chosen to improve quality of life without affecting 
performance. 

## Parity Features
Although Optifine's performance has declined in recent years compared to newer mods like Sodium, it remains unparalleled in its ability to provide unique features. Optifine's colored shader support, texture pack support to change entity models or textures, and animating mobs are not available in Sodium or similar mods. To address this issue, we've implemented mods like EMF, ETF, Animatica, and FabricSkyBoxes that offer Optifine's features while maintaining optimal performance with Sodium. With these mods, you can enjoy Optifine's amazing features while benefiting from Sodium's superior performance.

## Quilt Mod Loader
Truly Optimized is built on the [Quilt Mod Loader](https://quiltmc.org/en/), which provides a streamlined and modern modding toolchain with an open ecosystem. Quilt focuses on speed, usability, and modularity, making it the perfect choice for an optimized modpack like Truly Optimized.

## Fast Updates
Truly Optimized is regularly updated to ensure that it is always up-to-date and provides the best possible performance. These updates are fast, so players can be sure that they will always have access to the latest Minecraft optimizations.
